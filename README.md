MyFirst Git Project. Thanks Ma'am for This Opportunity. 

# Added Palindrome Program in Java
## Palindrome number algorithm
* Get the number to check for palindrome
* Hold the number in temporary variable
* Reverse the number
* Compare the temporary number with reversed number
* If both numbers are same, print "palindrome number"
* Else print "not palindrome number"

#Added Subtract Program in JAVA
It tells the difference when 50 is removed from 100

# Reverse a string using recursion
## Recursive Approach
* We will remove first character from the input string and append it at the end.
* Repeat it till all the characters are removed and input becomes empty.
